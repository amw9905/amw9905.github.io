I'm a Senior Data Scientist at [Ascend-Innovations](http://ascend-innovations.com/).  I received MS in Applied Mathematics and PhD in Mathematics from the University of Illinois. At the University of Illinois, I focused on dynamical systems, computational science, and statistical learning.  My professional career spans serval domains such as agriculture, weed science, healthcare, and public health. ([Resume](https://github.com/amw9905/amw9905.github.io/raw/master/Resume/Resume.pdf)).
